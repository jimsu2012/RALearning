# Jim's Work in "Learning Materials for Prospective Research Assistants"

## 1. Basic Concepts in GIS and Spatial Data
- Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python: **geospatial-data/ directory**
- Conduct the exercises in Python Jupyter Notebook: **exercises/ directory**
  - Note 1: some files are excluded from git since they exceed GitHub's 100 MB file size limit. They can be generated from the Jupyter notebook code or downloaded from the original dataset.
  - Note 2: for exercise 2, the release of TensorFlow 2 seems to have broken the model code. Some imports have been updated to match TensorFlow 2, but the model will not train appropriately (thus test/evaluation steps are omitted as they cannot be tested).
